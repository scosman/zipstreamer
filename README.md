**ZipStreamer** is a golang microservice for streaming zip files from a series of web links, on the fly. For example, if you have 200 files on S3, and you want to download a zip file of them, you can do so in 1 request to this server.

Highlights include:

 - Low memory: the files are streamed out to the client immediately
 - Low CPU: the default server doesn't compress files, only packages them into a zip, so there's minimal CPU load ([configurable](#customize-a))
 - High concurrency: the two properties above allow a single small server to stream hundreds of large zips simultaneous
 - [Easy to host](#deploy-a): several deployment options, including Docker images and two one-click deployers
 - It includes a HTTP server, but can be used as a library (see `zip_streamer.go`)

## JSON Zip File Descriptor 

Each HTTP endpoint requires a JSON description of the desired zip file. It includes a root object with the following structure:

 - `suggestedFilename` [Optional, string]: The filename to suggest in the "Save As" UI in browsers. Defaults to `archive.zip` if not provided or invalid. [Limited to US-ASCII.](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2183#section-2.3)
 - `files` [Required, array]: an array descibing the files to include in the zip file. Each array entry required 2 properties:
    - `url` [Required, string]: the public URL of the file to include in the zip. Zipstreamer will fetch this via a GET request. The file must be publically accessible via this URL; if you're files are private, most file hosts provide query string authentication options which work well with Zipstreamer (example [AWS S3 Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html)).
    - `zipPath`  [Required, string]: the path and filename where this entry should appear in the resulting zip file. This is a relative path to the root of the zip file.

Example JSON description with 2 files:

```
{
  "suggestedFilename": "tps_reports.zip",
  "files": [
    {
      "url":"https://server.com/image1.jpg",
      "zipPath":"image1.jpg"
    },
    {
      "url":"https://server.com/image2.jpg",
      "zipPath":"in-a-sub-folder/image2.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

## HTTP Endpoints

<a name="post-download-a"></a>
### POST /download

This endpoint takes a http POST body containing the [JSON zip file descriptor](#json-descriptor-a), and returns a zip file.

<details>
  <summary>Example usage</summary>

#### Example usage of POST endpoint

```
# download a json descriptor
curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/scosman/f57a3561fed98caab2d0ae285a0d7251/raw/4a9630951373e50f467f41d8c7b9d440c13a14d2/zipJsonDescriptor.json > zipJsonDescriptor.json
# call POST endpoint
curl --data-binary "@./zipJsonDescriptor.json" http://localhost:4008/download > archive.zip
```
</details>

<a name="get-download-a"></a>
### GET /download

This endpoint fetches a [JSON zip file descriptor](#json-descriptor-a) hosted on another server, and returns a zip file. This is useful over the `POST /download` endpoint for a few use cases:

 - You want to hide from the client where the original files are hosted (see `zsid` parameter)
 - Use cases where POST requests aren't easy to adopt (traditional static webpages)
 - You want to trigger a browsers' "Save File" UI, which isn't shown for POST requests. See `POST /create_download_link` if you prefer a client side method to achieve this, which doesn't require another host for the zip descriptor files.

This endpoint requires one of two query parameters describing where to find the JSON zip file descriptor:

 - `zsurl`: the full URL to the JSON file describing the zip. Example: `/download?zsurl=https://yourserver.com/path_to_descriptors/82a1b54cd20ab44a916bd76a5`
 - `zsid`: must be used with the `ZS_LISTFILE_URL_PREFIX` environment variable. The JSON file will be fetched from `ZS_LISTFILE_URL_PREFIX + zsid`. This allows you to hide the full URL path from clients, revealing only the end of the URL. Example: `ZS_LISTFILE_URL_PREFIX = "https://yoursever.com/path_to_descriptors/"` and `download?zsid=82a1b54cd20ab44a916bd76a5`

<details>
  <summary>Example usage</summary>

#### Example usage GET endpoint with zsurl parameter

```
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4008/download?zsurl=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/scosman/f57a3561fed98caab2d0ae285a0d7251/raw/4a9630951373e50f467f41d8c7b9d440c13a14d2/zipJsonDescriptor.json" > archive.zip
```

#### Example usage of GET endpoint with zsid parameter

```
# start server with ZS_LISTFILE_URL_PREFIX
ZS_LISTFILE_URL_PREFIX="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/scosman/" ./zipstreamer
```

```
# call GET endpoint with zsid
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4008/download?zsid=f57a3561fed98caab2d0ae285a0d7251/raw/4a9630951373e50f467f41d8c7b9d440c13a14d2/zipJsonDescriptor.json" > archive.zip
```

</details>

<a name="post-create-a"></a>
### POST /create_download_link

This endpoint takes a http POST body containing the [JSON zip file descriptor](#json-descriptor-a), stores it in a local cache, and returns a link ID which allows the caller to fetch the zip file via an additional call to `GET /download_link/{link_id}`.

This is useful for if you want to trigger a browser "Save File" UI, which isn't shown for POST requests. See `GET /download` for a server side method to achieve this.

*Important*:

 - These links only live for 60 seconds. They are expected to be used immediately.
 - This stores the link in an in-memory cache, so it's not suitable for deploying to a multi-server cluster without extra configuration. If you are hosting on a multi-server cluster, see the deployment section for configuration advice.

Here is an example response body containing the link ID. See docs for `GET /download_link/{link_id}` below for how to fetch this zip file:

```
{
  "status":"ok",
  "link_id":"b4ecfdb7-e0fa-4aca-ad87-cb2e4245c8dd"
}
```

Example usage: see `GET /download_link/{link_id}` documentation below.

<a name="get-link-a"></a>
### GET /download_link/{link_id}

Call this endpoint with a `link_id` generated with `/create_download_link` to download that zip file.

<details>
  <summary>Example usage</summary>

#### Example usage of create_download_link and download_link endpoints

```
# download a json descriptor
curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/scosman/f57a3561fed98caab2d0ae285a0d7251/raw/4a9630951373e50f467f41d8c7b9d440c13a14d2/zipJsonDescriptor.json > zipJsonDescriptor.json
# call POST endpoint to create link
curl --data-binary "@./zipJsonDescriptor.json" http://localhost:4008/create_download_link
# Note: must copy UUID from output of above command into this URL
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4008/download_link/UUID_FROM_ABOVE" > archive.zip
```

## Deploy

<a name="deploy-heroku-a"></a>
### Heroku - One Click Deploy

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/scosman/zipstreamer/tree/master)

Be sure to enable [session affinity](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/session-affinity) if you're using multiple servers and using `/create_download_link`.

<a name="deploy-google-a"></a>
### Google Cloud Run - One Click Deploy, Serverless

[<img src="https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg" width=180 alt="Run on Google Cloud">](https://deploy.cloud.run?git_repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fscosman%2Fzipstreamer)

Cloud Run is ideal serverless environment for ZipStreamer, as it routes many requests to a single container instance. ZipStreamer is designed to handle many concurrent requests, and will be cheaper to run on this serverless architecture than a instance-per-request architecture like AWS Lamba or Google Cloud Functions.

**Important** 
 - The one-click deploy button has [a bug](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-button/issues/232) and may force you to set the optional environment variables. If the server isn't working, check `ZS_URL_PREFIX` is blank in the Cloud Run console.
 - Be sure to enable [session affinity](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/session-affinity) if you're using using `/create_download_link`. Cloud Run may scale up to multiple containers automatically.

<a name="deploy-docker-a"></a>

<a name="customize-a"></a>
## Customization and Configuration

These environment variables can be used to configure the server:

 - `PORT` - Defaults to 4008. Sets which port the HTTP server binds to.
 - `ZS_URL_PREFIX` - If set, the server will verify the `url` property of the files in the JSON zip file descriptors start with this prefix. Useful to preventing others from using your server to serve their files.
 - `ZS_COMPRESSION` - Defaults to no compression. It's not universally known, but zip files can be uncompressed, and used only to combining many files into one file. Set to `DEFLATE` to use zip deflate compression. **WARNING - enabling compression uses CPU, and will reduce throughput of server**. Note: for files with internal compression (JPEGs, MP4s, etc), zip DEFLATE compression will often increase the total zip file size.
  - `ZS_LISTFILE_URL_PREFIX` - See documentation for `GET /download`

I was mentoring at a "Teens Learning Code" class, but we had too many mentors, so I had some downtime.
